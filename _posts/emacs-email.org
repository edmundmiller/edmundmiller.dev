** Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: introduction
:END:
Like most people these days I have quite a few email addresses,
personal, old personal email, and school. In the past I've tried using
Emacs to manage all of these in one place. However, when I added a work
email account into the mix that didn't have =IMAP= enabled it was
finally enough to make me go back to using the web clients.

Recently I started to get the itch to bring the config into my
[[https://github.com/Emiller88/dotfiles/tree/master/shell/notmuch][dotfiles]],
since the biggest pain was setting it all up on a new computer and
making it feel fragile.

** Fetching the Mail
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fetching-the-mail
:END:

In the past I've tried [[https://github.com/OfflineIMAP/offlineimap][offlineimap]] but it's slow when you have to pull down
years and years of email. So I first started with [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Isync][mbsync]](I've used the arch wiki
because it explains more than the actual documentation in my opinion).

To get that set up:

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt install isync
#+end_src

and then add a =~/.mbsyncrc= file and configure it according to one of the above
guides or the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Isync][arch wiki]]. I will try to avoid going over things that I just
copied and pasted and they worked, in order to keep this short.

An issue that I ran into later down the road was that [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Isync][mbsync]] doesn't sync just
any flag/label/tag back to Gmail. Enter [[https://github.com/gauteh/gmailieer][gmailieer]]. Which was more of a pain to
setup.

To install from [[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gmailieer][here]]

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt-get install gmailieer
#+end_src

The chicken and the egg problem with =gmailieer= is that it needs =notmuch= set
up in the =.mail= dir. So when I was setting =gmailieer= up, =notmuch= was
already up and running for me. We'll come back to it.

With =gmailieer= the important part, is if I check my email on my phone, another
computer, or Emacs, it will update as read, archived, deleted, and most
importantly the tags will be the same on it. For an added bonus it works for my
work account that uses Gsuite since it uses their API and not IMAP.

Now one key issue I had with =gmailieer= and my setup is that it depends on the
=python3-notmuch= package, which is in the Ubuntu repos but not in =pypi=. So
this makes it necessary to use a different version of python than Conda
3.6(default in 18.04 but you can use the =python-notmuch= package if you're on
16.04) I had to do the following(I use [[https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv][pyenv]] to manage different python
versions).

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt install python3-notmuch
cd ~/.mail
pyenv local 3.7.0 # or whatever version you like
#+end_src

We need to initialize the notmuch database.

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt-get install notmuch
cd ~/.mail
notmuch
#+end_src

Here you'll be prompted with some questions to get your config going. Below is
an example of what it'll look like afterwards

#+begin_src conf
[database]
path=/home/$USER/.mail

[user]
name=Edmund Miller
primary_email=USER1@gmail.com
other_email=USER3@gmail.com;USER2@school.edu;

[new]
tags=new
ignore=Trash;*.json;

[search]
exclude_tags=trash;deleted;spam;

[maildir]
synchronize_flags=true
#+end_src

** Checking Mail in the Background
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: checking-mail-in-the-background
:END:

Next we need to setup the mail to be ran in the background every so often. This
[[https://bostonenginerd.com/posts/notmuch-of-a-mail-setup-part-1-mbsync-msmtp-and-systemd/%0A][guide]] has a great setup for it.

#+begin_src bash
mklink checkmail.service $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/systemd/user/checkmail.service
mklink checkmail.timer $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/systemd/user/checkmail.timer
#+end_src

And start and enable the timer

#+begin_src bash
systemctl --user start checkmail.timer
systemctl --user enable checkmail.timer
#+end_src

The =checkmail.service= calls =checkmail.sh=

#+begin_src bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

STATE=$(nmcli networking connectivity)

if [ $STATE = 'full' ]; then
echo "Syncing email1"
cd /home/emiller/.mail/email1/
gmi sync
echo "Syncing email2"
cd /home/emiller/.mail/email2/
gmi sync
echo "Syncing work"
cd /home/emiller/.mail/work/
gmi sync
echo "Checking school"
# Non gmail email
    mbsync -V school
    exit 0
fi
echo "No internet connection."
exit 0
#+end_src

The =gmi sync= command does a =push= followed by a =pull= so the tags from the
local overwrite anything that's on the remote. So later we'll write rules to tag
the new mail coming in.

** Tagging the Mail
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tagging-the-mail
:END:

The next step is to tag the mail. For that I use =notmuch=. I tried =mu= in the
past but it works by moving the emails into various dirs instead of just tagging
them and I found it messed with how the remote emails were treated too often.
Gmailieer pulls the tags down by default. But if we want to tag our mail locally
we'll need to expand =checkmail.sh=. [[https://github.com/afewmail/afew][afew]] is another option for more elaborate
initial tagging, but I didn't want to have more dependencies.

#+begin_src bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

STATE=$(nmcli networking connectivity)

function tagMail {
echo "Running tag additions to tag new mail"

# github
notmuch tag +github              -- from:notifications@github.com AND tag:new
notmuch tag +github              -- from:noreply@github.com AND tag:new
notmuch tag -inbox               -- tag:github AND tag:new

# CI
notmuch tag +CI                  -- from:builds@travis-ci.com AND tag:new
notmuch tag +CI                  -- from:builds@circleci.com AND tag:new
notmuch tag -inbox               -- tag:CI AND subject:Passed

# Mailing Lists
notmuch tag +list/emacs -inbox   -- from:help-gnu-emacs-request@gnu.org AND tag:new
notmuch tag +list/haskell -inbox -- from:info@haskellweekly.news AND tag:new
notmuch tag +list/IPFS -inbox    -- from:newsletter@ipfs.io AND tag:new
notmuch tag +list/rust -inbox    -- from:twir@rust-lang.org AND tag:new
notmuch tag +list/nixos -inbox   -- from:domen@enlambda.com AND tag:new

# Remove new
notmuch tag -new                 -- tag:new
}
if [ $STATE = 'full' ]; then
echo "Syncing email1"
cd /home/emiller/.mail/email1/
gmi sync
echo "Syncing email2"
cd /home/emiller/.mail/email2/
gmi sync
echo "Syncing work"
cd /home/emiller/.mail/work/
gmi sync
echo "Checking school"
# Non gmail email
    mbsync -V school
echo "Running notmuch new"
    notmuch new
echo "Tagging mail"
tagMail
    exit 0
fi
echo "No internet connection."
exit 0
#+end_src

So what we're doing here is first calling =notmuch new= which tags everything
according to this section of the config. Which just tags everything with =new=
and ignores anything with the =Trash= tag.

#+begin_src conf
[new]
tags=new
ignore=Trash;*.json;
#+end_src

** Deleting Email
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: deleting-email
:END:

Notmuch by default doesn't tag things with =+trash= which makes gmail move the
emails to the trash. Here's a snippet that does that. I have this bound to =d=.

#+begin_src elisp
(defun +notmuch/search-delete ()
   (interactive)
  (notmuch-search-add-tag (list "+trash" "-inbox" "-unread"))
  (notmuch-tree-next-message))
#+end_src

** WIP: Sending Email
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: wip-sending-email
:END:

#+begin_quote
WIP: Currently I can only get this to work with my primary email address.
#+end_quote

To set this up we'll need to get started with pass. I suggest you have a look at
the [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/modules/email/notmuch/config.el][Doom Notmuch module]] if you're not using Doom to give you an idea of any
features you need to setup.

First setup =~/.msmtprc=

#+begin_src conf
# Set default values for all following accounts.
defaults
auth           on
tls            on
tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
logfile        ~/.msmtp.log

# Gmail
account        gmail
host           smtp.gmail.com
port           587
from           USER1@gmail.com
user           USER1
passwordeval   pass mail/USER1
#+end_src

Then we'll setup =pass=.

#+begin_src bash
pass init <GPG KEY>
pass insert mail/USER1
#+end_src

And type in the password.

You should be good to go and when in =notmuch= hit =C= and the =C-c C-c= to send
and =C-c C-k= to cancel.

#+begin_example
<normal-state> C    Compose new mail.
#+end_example
