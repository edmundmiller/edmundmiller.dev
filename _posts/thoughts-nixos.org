NixOS is a dream. It allows you to program your os by declaring what you want in
it. And then you can declare how you want your packages built. Most of the time
you just want the default, but for example

#+begin_src nix
(polybar.override {
  mpdSupport = true;
  pulseSupport = true;
  nlSupport = true;
})
#+end_src

It gives you the power to customize things when you want. And then contributing
packages is more developer focused, it's just a PR away. It makes it really
simple to mix bleeding edge, with stable.

The rollbacks are another big initial selling point that you kind of forget
about because things end up being so stable but they're the best. Basically in
your grub you can select any generation you'd like, so in case you wanted to try
out a new kernel and that break you just rollback to the previous generation.

The drawbacks are you need to understand a bit of functional programming, and
then on top of that you have to learn nix which is a dsl. There's nothing wrong
with the language, just that it's another thing you have to learn.

It may also kill your hobby of ricing. It makes it so quick to reproduce a
setup, that you can spend time actually thinking about the artistic portion and
not symlinking config files, and getting the right package version on ubuntu. I
follow a guy's dotfiles and he created a modular system, so your theme separate
from the logic that sets up your WM, so you can carry your rice across WM easily
and themeses across a wm.

Guix, cuts out the dsl issue with nix as the language. I love a good lisp
personally, and it's definately easier to pick up than nix. Nix/OS is also a
pretty old project, so it's grown over time, so the tooling was build up over
time so there's a bunch of different tools like nix-shell ,nixos-install,
nixos-rebuild, nix-env that are all at the first level where as guix has all of
those things under guix so it's better for new people to discover commands from.
Again the main issue is they're going to die on the FOSS hill, but I think
that'll get fixed with private package repos.

Now that's just all for the OS. They can both be used for dev-tools which is
where they really shine imo. You can use nix/guix on MacOS and any distro of
your choosing. You can create your builds and dev environment for any language
in them. So for example, you're just trying out python for the first time.
You're overwhelmed with the 20 different ways to set up a developement
environment. With nix it's just

#+begin_src nix
let pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {};
    nanomsg-py = .... build expression for this python library;
in pkgs.stdenv.mkShell {
buildInputs = [
    pkgs.pythonPackages.pip
    nanomsg-py
];
shellHook = ''
            alias pip="PIP_PREFIX='$(pwd)/_build/pip_packages' \pip"
            export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)/_build/pip_packages/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH"
            unset SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
'';
}
#+end_src

Another example that I had recently, was I needed an older version of node, but
I didn't want to clutter up my path with multiple node packages I just wanted to
build a project really quick with =node_10=. All it was is ~nix-shell -p
node_10~ and boom I had a shell with =node_10= installed. So then you can combo
the power of nix-shell with direnv, to automagically switch environments based
on what project your in, and it's easy for your team to replicate also, and
let's you be more language-agnostic because while tooling is awesome when it's
good(rust for example, or node possibly) when it's scary or the community get's
fragmented(python) it's a problem.
