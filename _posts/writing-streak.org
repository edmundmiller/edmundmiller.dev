This is my second year reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29093292-the-daily-stoic][The Daily Stoic]]. Of course with anything that
starts on January 1st, I'm a month behind half way through the year.

I was reading May 16th last night and it talked about "The Chain Method". Here's
the explanation:

#+begin_quote
The comedian Jerry Seinfeld once gave a young comic named Brad Isaac some advice
about how to write and create material. Keep a calendar, he told him, and each
day that you write jokes, put an X. Soon enough, you get a chain going—and then
your job is to simply not break the chain. Success becomes a matter of momentum.
Once you get a little, it’s easier to keep it going.

My partner has recently started writing a ton for her new job, and she loves a
streak so I suggested we start a writing streak on my [[https://brickademics.com/][Lego Grad Student]]
calendar(Which also happens to still be in May).

This is day one. This won't always be a blog post, it could be writing in [[https://slipbox.edmundmiller.dev/][my
slipbox]], or reading a paper and taking notes(also in the slipbox). We're also
counting writing documentation. I'm hoping the physical calendar and X's help!
