* Intro
- Feris Juggling the Julia logo
- Rust is the most loved language in stackoverflow *again*
- Julia is climbing the ranks
- Written in the last decade so they don't have to deal with legacy issues
* TODO Built-in package management
* TODO Central package store
* TODO Types
  - The best part is they're there when you want them(when you're developing packages)
* TODO Baked in testing suite is adequate(ie don't need pytest/jest)
* TODO Community
* TODO Easy version management
  https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup
* TODO Does it's main feature and does it well
  - Rust is focused on memory safety
  - Julia is focused on being fast
    - Link to why we wrote Julia
* But the compile times in both are slow!

But it's not going to get worse?
