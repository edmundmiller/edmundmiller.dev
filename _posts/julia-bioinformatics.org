Julia might just change the game for bioinformatics. Bioinformatics is starting
to heat up as field, and I think we have a lot of unique issues starting from
the days of [[https://bioperl.org/articles/How_Perl_saved_human_genome.html][perl and the Human Genome Project]].

Based off a recent recommendation from my friend [[https://github.com/tecosaur][Teco]]

** Two Language Problem
Plenty of people have written about this with Julia. Lots of scientific
communities may use a high-level "scripting" language to manage their
business-logic and then drop into a low-level language such as C/Fortran/Rust to
highly optimize the bottle-neck.

In bioinformatics we have a 5 language problem. From the perl script written
before the first generation of Next Generation Sequencing, to packages like
DESeq2 that aren't going to leave anyone's toolbox anytime soon, but no one is
going to rewrite, and instead are going to spend time teaching R to every
incoming generation of bioinformaticians just so they can use these influencial
packages. That's not including python, Rust, and of course, every
bioinformaticians favorite, bash. That's not including if you want to contribute
to any GATK cli tools written in Java.

Now, workflow managers such as [[https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/][Snakemake]] and [[https://www.nextflow.io/][Nextflow]] have fixed the majority of
those. Just stick those scripts in a container that acts as a time-capsule of
versions long forgotten and you can use them for just what you need and put them
back in closet.

But what about new scripts? When you're starting a new bioinformatics project in
2022, do you follow in the footsteps of the pioneers that came before you, and
learn how to call C functions in an R package? Or would you rather just see this beauty:

*** But what about my C functions that are highly optimized?

What about our in-house python library that interacts with all of our sample
tracking and pulling files temporarily from s3? "I don't have time to figure out
how to untangle that mess" you say. The Julia community wants to keep all of
those import scientific scripts written. Packages such as [[https://juliainterop.github.io/RCall.jl/][RCall.jl]], [[https://www.juliapackages.com/p/pycall][PyCall.jl]],
and plenty of others housed under [[https://github.com/JuliaInterop][Julia Interop]] allow for legacy code to fit
right into new code. As scientists we are constantly standing on the shoulders
of giants, and Julia is enabling that.

Julia has a wonderful open-source structure. Since it was created only a decade
ago there's not a lot of legacy things to maintain and everything can be fresh
and inclusive. Take for example the heavy use of organizations to house these
code repositories, which prevents packages from going unmaintained and orphaned
when the creator moves on.

While it's a relatively small community they've covered a wide range of the
various file types that we deal with on a daily basis. I hope to dog food most
of the packages to fill in some missing pieces, and improve documentation and
create some content for the community. The part that I found difficult was
finding the people based on the website. I joined the gitter to ask a question,
but luckily someone saw the message and told me that most of the real-time chat
happens in [[https://julialang.slack.com/archives/CAKKFNYLD][the #biology channel in the Julia slack]].


** Designed for Scientific Computing

It seems like bioinformaticians always want to do things in the most efficient
path, but solving for a different variable than most. [[https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/quantum-leaps-in-bioinformatics-with-lynn-langit/][In a recent episode of
screaming in the cloud]], [[https://lynnlangit.com/][Lynn Langit]] mentioned that in finance, they care about
getting the results as quickly as possible. The cost of the computing isn't a
factor. In bioinformatics, they're trying to solve for both time and cost,
trying to find the local minimum between both. There are plenty of time results
don't need to instant and waiting a few days to stretch a grant out is a
necessary evil.

Julia is fast, and that's been said numerous times, so you're probably guessing
I'm going to say you can save money by decreasing your compute time. While
that's true the piece that I think people aren't solving for in that equation is
developer time. Julia was designed from the ground up as a general programming
language for scientists ([[https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/][Why We Created Julia]]).

#+begin_quote
We want a language that's open source, with a liberal license. We want the speed
of C with the dynamism of Ruby. We want a language that's homoiconic, with true
macros like Lisp, but with obvious, familiar mathematical notation like Matlab.
We want something as usable for general programming as Python, as easy for
statistics as R, as natural for string processing as Perl, as powerful for
linear algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs together as the shell.
Something that is dirt simple to learn, yet keeps the most serious hackers
happy. We want it interactive and we want it compiled.
#+end_quote

That sounds like a bioinformaticians dream to me! Think of all of the time we
can save on developer experience, not trying to hack out some extra speed, or
fixing broken dependencies (or a complete lack of specified dependencies!).
Allowing legacy code to be treated like the crown jewel in our metaphorical
software crown, and wrapping it in some gold Julia code like it deserves.



** Call to action

I plan on working to increase the visability into Julia specifically for
bioinformatics. I always love this Venn diagram to explain to people what
Bioinformatics is. I think it'll be easy to cover [[https://github.com/JuliaData/][JuliaData]], [[https://juliastats.org/][JuliaStats]], and
[[https://biojulia.net/][BioJulia]] to cover all three and show people how the three intersect.
