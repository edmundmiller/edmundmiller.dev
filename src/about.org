** What's your PhD in again?

Technically, my degree program is in "Molecular and Cell Biology" but my main focus is functional genomics. To study it I use bioinformatics and computational biology techniques.

My actual research project is to better understand the biology of a type of nascent RNAs called enhancer RNAs(eRNAs). To do this I've dog-fooded [[https://nf-co.re/nascent][a highly reproducible pipeline to identify nascent RNA transcriptions]], using [[https://www.nextflow.io/][Nextflow]] and [[https://nf-co.re/][nf-core]] because slight changes in the processing of the data can result in ~25% difference in the results. Using those results I'm then working to better understand the function that eRNAs play on a genome wide scale.

*** Short Answer

Bioinformatics, Biology, I don't know, I write code.
