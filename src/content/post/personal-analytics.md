Let's see, so I recently followed the [blogging for devs](https://bloggingfordevs.com/) email course. Their recommendation was "_But get analytics set up because it can motivate you to keep going_". I had redone my personal site (_yet again_, blog post coming soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è), and I had also redone [my partner's site](https://monimiller.com/). I thought this might be a good time to be in the market for site analytics. I've been using [GoatTracker](https://www.goatcounter.com/GoatTracker), but I like to keep my yak herd well shaven.

## Requirements

Ideally I'd like something that's:

1. Not creepy
2. Self-hostable
3. But has a cloud option (I'm trying this new thing where I outsource my yak shaving)

Martin Tournoij, the author of GoatTracker, has a [good piece on analytics on personal websites](https://www.arp242.net/personal-analytics.html).

## Initial Research

I tried [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/DYRELW) first. It seemed popular, and it was alright but the pricing at $15 a month was unreasonable for our web traffic currently.

I'd tested out [Plausible](https://plausible.io) in the past. It looks cool, but there's no free tier. It's self-hostable, built on [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/), it's flashy, but probably overkill.

I was pretty excited to try [Umami](https://umami.is), the last time I had looked at it a while ago before it had a cloud hosting option. I think this one might be the only one to give GoatTracker a run for it's money. It has a hobby pricing of _free_ so it'll be hard to justify Plausible's $9 a month for the same 10K views.

## Conclusion

Going to use Plausible's free month to test Plausible, Umami, and GoatTracker together for a week or two since I've got it set up. Sorry for the slight performance hit for anyone reading this! üò¨
