This is my second year reading [The Daily
Stoic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29093292-the-daily-stoic). Of
course with anything that starts on January 1st, I\'m a month behind
half way through the year.

I was reading May 16th last night and it talked about \"The Chain
Method\". Here\'s the explanation:

> The comedian Jerry Seinfeld once gave a young comic named Brad Isaac
> some advice about how to write and create material. Keep a calendar,
> he told him, and each day that you write jokes, put an X. Soon enough,
> you get a chain going---and then your job is to simply not break the
> chain. Success becomes a matter of momentum. Once you get a little,
> it's easier to keep it going.

My partner has recently started writing a ton for her new job, and she
loves a streak so I suggested we start a writing streak on my [Lego Grad
Student](https://brickademics.com/) calendar(Which also happens to still
be in May).

This is day one. This won\'t always be a blog post, it could be writing
in [my slipbox](https://slipbox.edmundmiller.dev/), or reading a paper
and taking notes(also in the slipbox). We\'re also counting writing
documentation. I\'m hoping the physical calendar and X\'s help!
