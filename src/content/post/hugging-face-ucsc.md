I recently reanalyzed Mikkelson 2007 using nf-core to cut out some effort for the students in the Applied Genomics course I teach in the Summers. I threw the results up on Hugging Face because they'll host large amounts of data for free(IDK what rights I sign away in doing so but it's gotta be huge considering GitHub limits you to a max file size of 100mb)
