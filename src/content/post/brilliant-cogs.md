Full disclosure: I'm a startup person through and through. My entire career has been spent in the scrappy, move-fast-and-break-things world of startups. So when I talk about the empire, it's always been from the rebel perspective.

In genomics, if you're aware of the landscape at all, there's [an 800-pound gorilla in our industry](https://sandiegomics.com/2023-sequencing-market-share-the-tide-is-turning-very-slowly/). _As of 2023 they had 77.6% of the market share._

You don't really realize how insanely huge the empire is until your flying a X-wing right next to the death star. I'm extremely grateful that I got to experience being on the rebel side in my career. While it was exhilarating and exciting, it really made me start thinking about the economics of the genomics.

But to take the Star Wars metaphor another step, I met a lot of people that were ex-empire during my time with the rebels and I wondered how those brilliant individuals ended up as storm-troopers.

This [blog post, AWS Tools Suck](https://web.archive.org/web/20240521123134/https://www.cyclic.sh/posts/aws-tools-suck/), really shifted my perspective on all of these SaaS "remoras" that cling on to AWS, and you wonder why the AWS developer experience is so neglected.[^1]

I think a lot of really amazing people get caught up in these huge companies and are just brilliant cogs stuck in the bigger machine.

Maybe it's just the biologist in me, but I see business and the products and services they provide as organisms evolving to fill an ecological niche.

So ultimately, when a product sucks, I think it's a reflection of both environment and business goals. Not a reflection on the people(cells) individual skills and ability. A lot of times the business(see "organism") gains a competitive advantage from vertical integration. Their product doesn't have to be good, they just have to make it hard enough for people to get out of their product that they won't bother and will just let the trash compactor get them.(Thought we were done with the Star Wars references, did you?)
