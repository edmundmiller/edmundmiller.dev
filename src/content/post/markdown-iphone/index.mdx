Just frustrated myself. Obviously, I spent more than five minutes on playing around with Lume and getting in order mode and running it. I've got to render. I think I'll keep that branch alive just as a reminder to myself. I'm capable of doing those things. I can do them. But what does it matter? It's kind of like the run Graphene OS on my Android. I mean, I could do it. But at what cost? And while that was cute and fun and I enjoyed it a lot, it also caused some fights between my partner and I. And I couldn't pick her up from a concert. So I was going to reflect on these and reflect on the better half decade of not writing on this blog because I was just waiting to find the right org mode and combo with a static site generator of some sort. I don't care. I'm already in like a crazy niche of people who run their own blog. I was just trying to show off. I think I was just trying to prove that I could do it and I was capable of doing those things. I think that's the point. I could do that all along. Do I really need to? Do I really care? How? I don't. I have an iPhone now. I have an Apple Watch. I love Siri. It works. It gets the job done. Nobody cares if I run Graphene OS. Nobody understands me. Except some weirdos on the internet that I've never met. Maybe not weirdos. Most of the people are people on the internet that I've never met. Fighting a good fight. Most of the people in my life don't even know. So it really doesn't matter. So I just picked a blog with the email off the shelf. Went with it. Customized it. Went with Astro. Similarly to Nextflow. Don't really care what front-end framework. If I ever get an H2Rig and hodgepodge it all together. Hopefully that concept sticks around for a long time. I'll just keep on running it. It's good for the environment. Not the CO2 emissions. I'll write MDX. I don't care anymore. I'll use Orgrim for my personal stuff. And I'll keep everything else in MDX when I publish it on a blog. Not publishing that often anyways. Yeah. I think it's almost like the... For a moment of vulnerability here. It's really difficult to go and publish these things. And... Admit... That I've just... Not... That I was wrong. I just waste a lot of time. And effort. And energy. I should've just... Used Markdown. A long time ago. I should've just... Used Markdown. A long time ago.
