Okay, so Astro is the new hot new web framework on the block. All the cool kids are using it. I've recently drank the Kool-Aid and gone all in on it. Rewritten this website, partner's website, and of course rewritten its website on Astro. Rewritten my old rugby club's website. All in. Quick aside, the beauty of Astro is it's like the next flow of web frameworks. In parentheses, can you use a niche, a very niche programming language to describe a niche programming language? If not, look up what Nextflow is. Essentially what I mean is it allows you to wrap other web frameworks in a web framework rather than forcing you to pick one so you don't just have to pick React or Vue. You can have both in the same application. That's the beauty. That's why it's exciting. That's why it's like I don't care. I can use whatever hot web framework someone comes up with. So anyways, I wanted to hook you, Max, up to Astro. For now, I've just kind of been roughing it out there and writing prettier by itself and turn off save on format and auto-complete. It's been scary.
