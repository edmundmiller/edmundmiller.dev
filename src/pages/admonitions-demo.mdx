<Admonition type="tip" title="Performance Optimization">
For better performance, consider:

1. Enabling caching
2. Using CDN for static assets
3. Implementing lazy loading
4. Minimizing bundle size

These optimizations can improve your Core Web Vitals scores significantly.

<Admonition type="example" title="Code Example">
Here's how to use the new API:

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@my-api/client';

const client = createClient({
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
  version: 'v2'
});

const result = await client.fetchData();
console.log(result);
```

Remember to handle errors appropriately in production code.
