I recently was helping a friend start building a website, and in hopes of
boosting his resume, chose to build it in [[https://reactjs.org][React]], and because I think the best
way to master something is to teach it. I had picked up the frame work through
work, and I recommend [[https://react.holiday][React Holiday]] for anyone trying to pick it up with just a
few minutes a day to spare. The title came from the number of friends that I
have that have learned the popular framework and then been able to move out of
their parent's house. I also was inspired by the [[https://www.hntrends.com][Hacker News Hiring Trends]] which
claims react has been the most popular skill requested for 22 months and made up
28% of all job postings in March 2019. Because of the surplus of tutorials that
seem to teach you =Just Enough= â„¢. Hopefully this post will be enough to get you
going from zero to out of your parent's house.

** Install git
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: install-git
:ID:       45c2a62e-a77c-4e24-8dc2-ec9c6d757c27
:END:

You'll want install =git= next. Follow the instructions at this [[https://git-scm.com][site to install]]
for your platform.

** VS Code
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: vs-code
:ID:       84ac4dd1-5fba-40d6-a532-d46414e6a2d0
:END:

I personally don't use VS Code, I use [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] but that's a whole other beast.
With that disclaimer I recommend VS Code to friends new to programming because
it is the popular GUI editor of the hour. You can download it [[https://code.visualstudio.com][here]].

** Fira Code
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fira-code
:ID:       b0dbec51-623e-450a-9e42-fa9b84e13006
:END:

A fun little thing to make you feel like a special snowflake is to change your
font in your editor. I like to recommend =FiraCode= because it has ligature
support with overwhelming you with options. You can see how to install it on
your system and add it VS Code [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki][here]].

** Install nodejs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: install-nodejs
:ID:       fb949920-4762-4c90-b11d-f838edbe1a9d
:END:

/Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine/. is the
description their site gives. We'll cover more on JS later. The link to the
[[https://nodejs.org/en/download/][Download page]].

** Installing Extensions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installing-extensions
:ID:       8fee9d0d-0466-4ae6-b0d0-31a7699f6958
:END:

One of the perks of VS Code is that it makes install extensions simple. They can
be installed by clicking the square icon on the left side of VS Code. The list
of what I recommend for following this guide:

- [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons][vscode-icons]]
- [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer][Bracket Pair Colorizer]]
- [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome][Debugger for Chrome]]
- [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens][GitLens]]
- [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme][One Dark Pro]]
- [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync][Settings Sync]]
- [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.vscode-npm-script][npm]]
- [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets][React Snippets]]
- [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode][VS Intellicode]]
- [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zignd.html-css-class-completion][IntelliSense for CSS]]
- [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense][Path Intellisense]]

You should glance over each and see what they give you.

*** [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode][prettier]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: prettier
:ID:       68429950-0056-4df2-a358-374f424bc6fa
:END:

=prettier= formats the code you on save. Follow the instructions on the
page to set it up.

*** [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig][EditorConfig]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: editorconfig
:ID:       7ed81fc1-0eb9-46a6-85f0-71301dfcd062
:END:

Another way to keep your code clean and set a standard. Can you tell I
like clean code?

*** [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint][eslint]]
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: eslint
:ID:       e7b86eaa-008a-4dfa-a8e5-1fa0c5f0b530
:END:

=ESLint= tells you when you've done something wrong and sometimes can fix it for
you.

** Integrated Terminal
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: integrated-terminal
:ID:       cca92706-1585-4819-96a7-1942c44a4d99
:END:

If you know how to get a terminal on your system already awesome. If you don't
know what I'm writing about, we're just going to use the integrated terminal. [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal][A
quick doc on it]], I recommend you use =git bash= if you're on [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal#_windows][windows]].


* GitHub
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: github
:ID:       5224342e-c952-426e-9178-26a3137e7e4e
:PUBDATE:  2023-08-16 Wed 22:36
:END:

** Create an Account
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: create-an-account
:ID:       69997f9f-7606-4ed5-b7f6-a31fb3abed31
:END:

If you don't have one yet that's fine. It should be self explanatory. Bonus if
you're a student, sign up for the [[https://education.github.com/pack][Student Pack]]. I am not spelling out a majority
of this tutorial because of the various different platforms people are one would
make it quite long, and because part of developing software is learning to read
the friendly manual. Think of it more of a checklist.

** Create a Repo
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: create-a-repo
:ID:       878618bb-6f15-4f1f-81b9-7e2416e51507
:END:

I would be doing the docs at GitHub a disservice if I tried to take their
tutorial so here is [[https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-new-repository][Creating a new repository]]. We won't be covering a personal
site today so name it whatever you like. I'll be referring to it as
=example-site=.

** Clone the repo
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: clone-the-repo
:ID:       c8044a19-f5b1-4acb-b175-3c467bfaaeed
:END:

Using your =Integrated Terminal= follow this [[https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository][guide]] to clone your site. In my
case it would be:

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/emiller88/example-site
#+end_src


* Getting the Site set up
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: getting-the-site-set-up
:ID:       c78484cb-53d9-48b2-aabf-f04559ea5c41
:PUBDATE:  2023-08-16 Wed 22:36
:END:

Now that I've bored you with all of the tooling, or if you enjoyed it, we're on
to the real work.

** Create React App
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: create-react-app
:ID:       ace4ed7e-c92c-4f2a-a00c-74317e32a285
:END:

Is a great utility to get your up and running with =React=

#+begin_src bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
#+end_src

If you installed =nodejs= correctly earlier this should go off without a hitch
and you should have a browser popup with your site. This is a =local= site that
hot reloads whenever you edit anything in the project so you can get feedback if
your change is correct quickly.

** GitHub Pages
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: github-pages
:ID:       c1e84d1c-257a-4dd7-b2b6-60a165e25e9b
:END:

Follow the [[https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages#procedure][Procedure]], you should be able to skip to step 3. replace
=react-gh-pages= with =example-site= or whatever you chose.

** CircleCI
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: circleci
:ID:       db738b27-5dac-40ad-92da-188b1fac819f
:END:

Lastly, we'll setup a CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy and build your site
whenever you push code to master. You'll want to [[https://circleci.com][create an account]] and link your
GitHub. We'll be following this [[https://circleci.com/blog/automate-your-static-site-deployment-with-circleci/][blog post]]. Here is the =.circleci/config.yml=
you'll need to add to your project.

#+begin_src yaml
version: 2
jobs:
build:
    docker:
    # specify the version you desire here
    - image: circleci/node:lts
# Specify service dependencies here if necessary
    # CircleCI maintains a library of pre-built images
    # documented at https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/circleci-images/
    # - image: circleci/mongo:3.4.4
working_directory: ~/repo
steps:
    - checkout
# Download and cache dependencies
    - restore_cache:
        keys:
        - v1-dependencies-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
        # fallback to using the latest cache if no exact match is found
        - v1-dependencies-
- run: npm install
- save_cache:
        paths:
            - node_modules
        key: v1-dependencies-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
# run tests!
    - run: npm run test
    - deploy:
        name: deploy to GH-Pages
        command: npm run deploy
#+end_src


* React
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: react
:ID:       1718f95c-e960-4631-b4ec-3764cb8676ee
:PUBDATE:  2023-08-16 Wed 22:36
:END:

It's about time we actually talked about =React=. As you can see though a good
chunk of development is just setting up the project. There's obviously the link
to the official documentation that comes in the =create-react= starter page
which I recommend you read. But now that we're to the actual meat I'll take you
through a few things.

** React bootstrap
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: react-bootstrap
:ID:       c83e99ff-1a0b-4dfc-8ec1-68cf095394da
:END:

If you've ever seen a basic website recently it might be made with bootstrap. It
was recreated for use with [[https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction][React]].

[[https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction][To get started with it]] run the following and then follow the docs.

#+begin_src bash
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
#+end_src
