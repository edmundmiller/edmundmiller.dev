I've been trying to use Julia more for some tertiary analysis of genomic data.
It seems that [[https://biojulia.net/][BioJulia]] has a package for every bioinformatics format created, so
far. However, I've been missing the supplementary blog posts that show you the
real world use of these packages. Or maybe something like the great
documentation [[https://biocore-ntnu.github.io/pyranges/][PyRanges]] has.

So you want to find some overlaps?

#+begin_src julia
using GenomicFeatures
using BED

# Create an interval collection in memory.
h3k27ac_icol = open(BED.Reader, "H3K27ac.consensus_peaks.bed") do reader
    IntervalCollection(reader)
end

p63_icol = open(BED.Reader, "p63_4A4.consensus_peaks.bed") do reader
    IntervalCollection(reader)
end

overlap_icol = eachoverlap(h3k27ac_icol, p63_icol)
overlaps = collect(overlap_icol)
overlaps
