#+title: Using Age with org-journal

* Why not just gpg?

Because [[https://dev.gnupg.org/T6481][gpg 2.4.1 borked]] Emacs's EasyPG. And then ~lib-gcrypt~ is marked as
broken in NixOS if you use the ~gnupg22~ package(Version: 2.2.41), and a blowing
past that stop sign sounded like a bad idea.

So I started thinking outside the box.

* Why [[https://github.com/FiloSottile/age][age]]?

I started using it with [[https://github.com/ryantm/agenix][agenix]], just because [[https://github.com/hlissner/][Henrik]] started using it in his
dotfiles. The [[https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template][k8s@home template]] also eventually [[https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template/pull/153][switched from gpg to age]] so I
was already pretty comfortable with using age.

TL;DR [[https://nixfaq.org/2021/01/age-the-modern-alternative-to-gpg.html][Age: the modern alternative to GPG â€” nixFAQ]]:

- Age is presented as a modern alternative to GPG that solves many of its
  limitations while maintaining security.
- Age stands for "Actually Good Encryption" and has implementations in Go and
  Rust for improved security compared to GPG's C implementation.
- Age uses smaller keys that are easier to store physically and has a simpler
  interface with no configuration options.
- Files can be encrypted for multiple recipients simultaneously using Age.
- Age supports encrypting for SSH public keys in addition to its own keys.
- Age allows encrypting files for GitHub users by using their SSH keys from
  their profile.
- Age offers a better user experience than GPG while maintaining an equally high
  level of security.

* Why still org-journal?
