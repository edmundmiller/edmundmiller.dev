** Enhancers

- Cis-acting DNA sequences that can increase the transcription of genes [fn:1:
  [cite:@Pennacchio_2013]]
- The human genome contains hundreds of thousands of enhancers
- Thought to work through DNA looping
- Evidence of Enhancer-Promoter interaction from cross-linking assays(3c)

** Why are Enhancers difficult to identify?

# Do I want to break these up into seperate slides to keep attention?

1. Scattered across the 98% of the human genome that does not encode proteins [fn:1: [cite:@Pennacchio_2013]]
2. Enhancers location relative to their target gene (or genes) is highly
  variable. They can be upstream, downstream, or within introns. [fn:1:
  [cite:@Pennacchio_2013]]
3. Enhancers do not necessarily act on the respective closest promoter but can
  bypass neighbouring genes to regulate genes located more distantly along a
  chromosome [fn:1: [cite:@Pennacchio_2013]]
4. One Enhancer can regulate multiple genes [fn:2: [cite:@Locksley_2001]] and One
  gene can be regulated by multiple enhancers [fn:3: [cite:@Kim_2018]]
5. The general sequence code of enhancers, if one exists at all, is poorly
  understood. [fn:1: [cite:@Pennacchio_2013]]
6. The activity of enhancers can be restricted to a particular tissue or cell type

** eRNAs Introduction

- Sense and antisense transcripts from enhancers
- Play a role in the activation because the knockdown of a subset of the eRNAs
  resulted in decreased gene transcription [fn:: [cite:@Shiekhattar_2010]]
- Used to identify active enhancers

** GRO-Seq pros and cons
*** Pros:

- Maps nascent capped 5' RNA sequence at any given time
- Determines activity of transcription sites
- No prior knowledge of transcription sites needed

*** Cons:

- Limited to cell cultures and other artificial systems due to incubation with
  labelled nucleotides

** Reproduction with Parallel IMR Dataset

- Wrote workflow using snakemake
- Goal was to reproduce GM results
- Achieved *80%* of predicted eRNAs due to difficulty with nascent transcript
  identification

** Hypothesis

- Does the standardization of secondary analysis and use of transcription start
  sites for calling enhancer RNAs improve the accuracy full transcript
  identification?
- Using the streamlined process of transcript identification can new dynamics
  and classes of eRNAs can be indentified from massively parrallel processing of
  publicly accessible nascent trancript assay across cell lines?
* Aims
* Aim 1 Create a best practice secondary analysis pipeline for nascent transcripts
** Standardizing Snakemake

- January 2020
- Template
- Universal Commands
- Testing
- CI/CD
- Wrappers

#+attr_latex: :height 0.7\linewidth
#+begin_src bash
# Install nextflow
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
mv nextflow ~/bin/

# Launch the Nascent pipeline
nextflow run nf-core/nascent \
    --input samplesheet.csv \
    --genome GRCh38 \
    -profile docker
#+end_src

** Inheriting nf-core Nascent

- Breaking our analysis up into smaller pieces
- nf-core portion includes Quality Checks, alignment, graph generation, transcript
  identification, and transcript quantification
- Downstream analysis is then a seperate nextflow workflow
- Data engineering/Data Science split

** Nascent Goals

- Benchmark aligners to find best practices(Lots of opinions, no hard numbers)
- Handle alignment, QC, Genome graph generation, and naive transcript
  identification

* Aim 2 Take advantage of New Developments to improve eRNA annotation
** New developments

- CHM13 Released
- PINTS and transcriptional regulatory elements (TREs) matrix

** PINTS

- Can we use PINTS for Nascent Transcript Assays?
- Can we swap naive method of selecting for Histone modications with PINTS
  indentified transcriptional regulatory elements (TREs)?
- Can we indetify full length transcripts from the Nascent Transcript assays?

* Aim 3 Compare eRNA dynamics between cell lines
** IMR and GM

** HOX and Cancer cell lines
