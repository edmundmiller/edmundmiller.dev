** Enhancers Image

** Enhancers Fun facts

- Cis-acting DNA sequences that can increase the transcription of genes [fn:1:
  [cite:@Pennacchio_2013]]

** Topologically Associating Domain (TAD)
** Why are Enhancers difficult to identify?

1. Scattered across the 98% of the human genome that does not encode proteins [fn:1: [cite:@Pennacchio_2013]]
2. Enhancers location relative to their target gene (or genes) is highly
  variable. They can be upstream, downstream, or within introns. [fn:1:
  [cite:@Pennacchio_2013]]
3. Enhancers do not necessarily act on the respective closest promoter but can
  bypass neighbouring genes to regulate genes located more distantly along a
  chromosome [fn:1: [cite:@Pennacchio_2013]]
4. One Enhancer can regulate multiple genes [fn:2: [cite:@Locksley_2001]] and One
  gene can be regulated by multiple enhancers [fn:3: [cite:@Kim_2018]]
5. The general sequence code of enhancers, if one exists at all, is poorly
  understood. [fn:1: [cite:@Pennacchio_2013]]
6. The activity of enhancers can be restricted to a particular tissue or cell type
