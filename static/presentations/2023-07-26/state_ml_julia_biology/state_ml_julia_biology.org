* Abstract :noexport:

Exploring the use of Julia, in analyzing biological data. Discussion of libraries and packages, challenges and opportunities of using machine learning on biological data, and examples of past and future applications.

* Description :noexport:

This talk, "Exploring the State of Machine Learning for Biological Data in Julia," will delve into the use of the high-performance programming language, Julia, in analyzing biological data. We will discuss various libraries and packages available in Julia, such as BioJulia and Flux.jl, and the benefits of using Julia for machine learning in the field of biology. Additionally, the challenges and opportunities that arise when using machine learning techniques on biological data, such as dealing with high-dimensional and heterogeneous data, will be addressed. The talk will also include examples of how machine learning has been applied to biological data in the past and what the future holds for this field.

* About me

- Phd Candidate @ University of Texas at Dallas
- nf-core maintainer

#+beamer: \pause

- Been Machine Learning curious since around 2017
- Never took Linear Algebra

#+beamer: \pause

- I had some questions
  - What are the trade offs of all these packages?
  - How do we load biological data? (Personal interest in genomics)

* Goal of /most/ Biologists
# scope

- We're not trying to create novel models
- We're trying to apply these models in novel ways
- Then make biological inferences


* Old overview

- Ability to call Python and R packages
- What are all of these different ML Packages?
- Loading biological file formats
- Some pretty basic toy examples

* Then I had a thought...

#+beamer: \pause

- What if I reproduce some analyses and recount what I learned along the way?

* mlf-core - Concept

#+begin_src python
# Install mlf-core
$ pip install mlf-core

# Get an overview of all commands
$ mlf-core --help

# Check out all available templates
$ mlf-core list

# Get started and create your first project
$ mlf-core create

* TODO mlf-core - Why do we care about Reproducibility?

- why does reproducibility mater in science?
  - compared to selling ads, chatbots
- Lives are at stake
#+beamer: \pause
  - Treatment
#+beamer: \pause
  - Future scientists who can't reproduce it.


* What are all of these Packages?

- Flux.jl
- SciML
- MLJ
- fast.ai
- MLJFlux.jl

* Loading biological file formats in a training data format

- FASTA
- BAM
- BED

* Reproduce https://github.com/mlf-core/lcep?

* TODO Hooking up to CUDA
https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/gpu/
* Using it in collab

* Things I didn't get answers to
- What would loading up BAMs like Deepvariant look like?
* Conclusion

#+beamer: \pause
- I need to read a few books on linear algebra
