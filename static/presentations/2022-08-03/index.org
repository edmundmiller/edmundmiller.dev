* What is biotech?
** General definition of biotech

#+begin_quote
The integration of natural sciences and engineering sciences in order to
achieve the application of organisms, cells, parts thereof and molecular
analogues for products and services
#+end_quote

** General definition of biotech

- Covers a broad range of things from *artificial selection* to *genetic
  engineering*
- How can we use biological systems to make products?
    - Human-derived agriculture
    - Brewing
    - Selective breeding to improve the production of crops and livestock
- According to wikipedia there are "colors" of biotechnology

** YC on Biotech

#+begin_quote
A revolution is happening in life sciences that is reminiscent of what happened
in software in the 90’s. Now that cost and cycle time have decreased for
biotech, it’s possible for new startups to do groundbreaking work.
#+end_quote


** Umbrella term that includes many things such as?

- Food & agriculture
- Energy (biofuels)
- Microbiology (DNA engineering)
- Bioengineering
- Medicine & pharmaceuticals

* National relevance & problems

** Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (*GINA* 2008)

  - Prohibits health insurers from denying coverage to a healthy individual or
    charging that person higher premiums based solely on a genetic
    predisposition
  - Covers /most/ situations

** DNA sequencing regulation (23 & Me)

- 23andMe is not a medical provider
  - Doesn't have to follow HIPAA
  - GINA does not extend to discrimination based on genetic information for
    long-term care or disability-insurance providers

- According to section 8 of the terms of service:

#+begin_quote
23andMe is free to preserve and disclose any and all Personal Information to law
enforcement agencies or others if required to do so by law or in the good faith
belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary
#+end_quote

* GMOs
** What are GMOs?

- Genetically Modified Organism
- Modified in a laboratory using genetic engineering or transgenic technology


** Argument for GMOs

- Have traits such as drought & pest resistant.
- We've been using plant breeding for a long time already, this is just an
  improved version.
- Plants get infections and genetically modified in nature anyways.
- We need to find solutions to increased food demands as our population grows.

** Argument against GMOs

- There is no scientific consensus on the safety of GMOs
- Most of the research used to claim that GMOs are safe has been performed by
  biotechnology companies. (Conflict of Interest)

** CRISPER / Cas9 :ATTACH:

#+begin_quote
If scientists can dream of a genetic manipulation, CRISPR can now make it happen
#+end_quote

** Controversy of CRISPER / Cas9

- Chinese scientist He Jiankui claims to have used CRISPR-Cas9 to create embryos
  that resulted in twin girls
- It's a great technology with tons of potential, but what are the regulations
  and ethical questions that need to be answered?
- Accelerated the field before consensus has been achieved on how to use it.

* International relevance & problems

** Bioweapons

- Common example is *anthrax* infection caused by the bacterium /Bacillus
  anthracis/
- Lack of regulations for materials to create a novel bioweapon could lead to
  domestic terrorism
- COVID-19 response
