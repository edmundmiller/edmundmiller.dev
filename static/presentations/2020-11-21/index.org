* Oxidative phase

 
** Oxidative phase

- The breakdown of glucose, in glycolysis provides the first 6-carbon,
  glucose-6-phosphate
- The steps are *irreversible* 
  
Glucose-6-phosphate + 2 NADP+ ->
*** Notable Products
Ribulose-5-phosphate + 2 NADPH

** Step 1

- Glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized
- NADPH is produced as a byproduct as NADP+ is reduced 
- 6-phosphogluconate is formed
  
** Step 2

- Oxidative decarboxylation of 6-phosphogluconate
  + CO_{2} is released 
  + The electrons released are used to reduce NADP+ to NADPH 
- Ribose-5-phosphate is produced
  
* Non-oxidative phase

** Non-oxidative phase

- The steps are *reversible*
- Allows different molecules to enter the pathway at different stages
  (interconvert sugars)
*** Notable Products
- Ribose-5-Phosphate
- 2 fructose-6-phosphate
- glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 
  
** Step 3 - Rearrangement of Ribulose-5-phosphate 

*** Ribose-5-phosphate 
  + isomerization (exchange of groups between carbons)
*** Xylulose-5-phosphate
  + epimerization (exchange of groups on a single carbon)

*** The three pentose phosphates are in equilibrium because the reactions are reversible

* Study Guide Review
** Understand that glucose can be used as a source of NADPH *and* of building blocks for biosynthetic pathways

- Glucose is broken down in glycolysis into Glucose-6-phosphate
- Glucose-6-phosphate is passed to the *oxidative phase*
- The *oxidative phase* and produces *2 NADPH*
  
- The *non-oxidative phase* can produce *ribose-5-phosphate*
  + *ribose-5-phosphate* is used for nucleotide biosynthesis
  
** Two oxidative reactions of the pathway provide NADPH for biosynthesis

- The oxidative phase and produces 2 NADPH one for each oxidation

** The non-oxidative reactions of the pathway provide ribose-5-phosphate for the biosynthesis of nucleotides

- Rearrangement of *Ribulose-5-phosphate* 
  + Produces *Ribose-5-phosphate* 
    - isomerization (exchange of groups between carbons)

** The products of the non-oxidative branch (fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) can be returned to glycolysis or gluconeogenesis

*** When *more* ribose-5-P than NADPH is required

- Fructose-6-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P from Glycolysis are fed into the
  non-oxidative branch
  + The reaction then runs in _reverse_ to make ribose-5-P with *no* NADPH generated
- *No* carbon is returned to glycolysis  
  
** The pentose phosphate pathway can operate in four different modes according to the cellâ€™s requirements for NADPH, ribose-5-phosphate and ATP
*** When *both* ribose-5-P and NADPH are required
*** When *more* ribose-5-P than NADPH is required
*** When *more* NADPH than ribose-5-P is required
*** When *both* NADPH and ATP are needed, but ribose-5-P is not
** When *both* ribose-5-P and NADPH are required

- The predominant mode is to make NADPH and to make ribose-5-P 
- The oxidative reactions predominate
- no carbon is returned to Glycolysis 
  
** When *more* ribose-5-P than NADPH is required

- Fructose-6-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P from Glycolysis are fed into the
  non-oxidative branch
  + The reaction then runs in _reverse_ to make ribose-5-P with *no* NADPH generated
- *No* carbon is returned to glycolysis
  
** When *more* NADPH than ribose-5-P is required

6 Glucose-6-phosphate -> 6 ribose-5-P + 12 NADPH + 6 CO_{2} by the pentose phosphate pathway 

6 ribose-5-P -> 4 fructose-6-P + 2 glyceraldehyde-3-P

4 fructose-6-P + 2 glyceraldehyde-3-P -> 5-glucose-6-P by gluconeogenesis

Net reaction:

Glucose-6-phosphate + 12 NADP+ -> 6 CO_{2} + 12 NADPH

** When *both* NADPH and ATP are needed, but ribose-5-P is not

- The same as the previous case, but the =fructose-6-P= and =glyceraldehyde-3-P=
  are fed into glycolysis to generate ATP
